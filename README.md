# my-mastermind
this program is all about. mastermind.py must contain code that implements the Mastermind game described above in an object-oriented fashion. Here are some considerations:
How can we represent a Mastermind board game? (state of an object)
What are some operations associated with this game? (operations associated with an object)
Think what things users can do with the game and we make public methods for users to call to do those things
A user can set up a game
A user can play the game
A user can dump the game state after the game end
Anything else?
Think what are some internal operations the game must perform and we make private methods for them

Determine if the game is finished
